## How to Get Started

Getting into cybersecurity can be a bit daunting. It is a huge and rapidly evolving field that contains numerous specializations including penetration testing, incidence response, digital forensics, network engineering, malware analysis, and more.

If you are just getting started here is what we recommend:

1. Learn Linux and/or Windows Server as well as Bash or Powershell respectively.

2. Learn the basics of computer networking and the OSI Model.

3. Interact with the club and ask questions. We want to help!


## Our GitHub Organization

[CofC Cyber Security Club on GitHub](https://github.com/cofcsecurity)

We have a lot of resources and projects we are working on over on GitHub, check it out! If you are an active club member we will also add you to the organization upon request so you can contribute as well.


## Linux

Linux is a family of open source operating systems. Many prominent Linux distributions (distros) exist and are designed for a variety of use cases including personal computers (ex Ubuntu, Fedora), mobile devices (ex Android), embedded devices (ex BusyBox), and servers (ex Red Hat, Ubuntu Server).

### Getting Started

1. [Linux Command Line for Beginners by Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners)
2. [Linux Command Line Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBf0hzazHTGMh2fe2MFf3lCgk0rKmS2by)

### Infosec Oriented Distros

There are Linux distros specifically built with pentesting and infosec in mind. Here are some of our favorites.
If you are new to linux/cybersecurity we recommend you start with Kali.

1. [Kali](https://www.kali.org/downloads/)
- [Kali using Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://www.kali.org/news/wsl2-and-kali/)
2. [Parrot](https://parrotlinux.org/download/)
3. [Black Arch](https://www.blackarch.org/downloads.html)

### Other Important Distros

1. [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)
2. [Ubuntu and Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/)
3. [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux)
4. [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/)
5. [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/)

## Virtualization

Hypervisors like VirtualBox and VMware allow you to create and run virtual machines (VMs) on your computer. This allows you to run multiple operating systems on one computer, each in its own virtualized environment.

We recommend you set up Kali Linux in either VirtualBox or VMware using the guides [here](https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/).

1. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. [VMware Workstation Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html)
3. [Installation guide]()
